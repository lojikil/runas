# Radical Underground Newsletter Anarchist Society (RUNAS seriously, no one noticed that. or didn't say that. if you see something, say something. Sounds kinda weird I guess, but it works for titles too. Besides, you probably can't even see this, the subject is just too long. I could say something foul here, and no one would notice. Fiddlesticks. I'm not very good at this)

Friday Roundup, written whenever, because you're not like my mom, ok?

# Ask Stefan Anything

Apparently from twitter the questions were either "why," something foul, or a question about my CTF. So!

- Why?

Why not man.

- Why?

¬\_¬"

- Why?

Because I wanted to, ok? gosh.

- About what? (thanks Dino)

    ^^^ THIS GUY? AMIRITE?

- Are you the real @sae? (KCOD hitting with an actual question)

    Maybe man, like I don't even know anymore.

- Will you help me run my CTF?

    Sure kid, here's a nickel.

- does it matter? (JC, hitting deep)

    Nope. in the end we're just ghosts driving machines made of meat & space dust in a cosmic void that has no cognitive recognition of our infinitesimal lives. 

- if you had another career, what would it be? (thanks Dino, part Deux)

    I'd probably go back into carpentry if I was no longer doing computering, or farming. I actually like to work with my hands quite a bit, and it's honest-if-hard work. As most people know, I've actually a background in philosophy, but I worked illegally from 11 to 18 as a carpenter's apprentice, so it's something I've always enjoyed. 

- tomorrow i'm going to be dropped into the middle of bulgaria with nothing but the clothes on my back. what three things should i know ahead of time? (JC, part Deux)

    Bulgaria is a pretty interesting country, a heady mix of southern Slav, old Churches, and Turkish influences. It's also probably one of the least-accessible countries I've ever been to in Europe; even Turkey was easier & safer to get around without speaking Turkish (in fact, I would say that Istanbul and the like were dangerously simple to get around, enough so that you may let your guard down). So here are my three things:

1. Go to Church or the inn. Most churches & monasteries in Bulgaria have small kitchens that they can serve food out of. These form both the alms kitchens, as well food for sale to people traveling near by. The food is cheap, or free, and of fairly high quality, because the monks eat there themselves. Mountain inns, or a Mekhana, are similar setups, but generally run as for-profit businesses. They're also cheap, serve traditional foods, and generally focus on "power meals" like шкембе (cream of tripe soup) or боб чорба (bean soup). 

2. Slav Squat. Believe it or not, Bulgaria still has a preference for squat toilets, esp. in public places or older buildings. Whilst most (but not all!) new apartments have western-style toilets, many places in smaller cities and villages can still have squat, or Turkish, toilets. 

3. Enjoy the little things. Bulgaria is known for some strange things: Pravetz computers, Svoge chocolate (it was one of the largest COMINTERN Chocolate producers), and Basically everything Rose (rose wine, rose mineral water, rose-flavored Turkish Delights). The Bulgarian Makarov is a fascinating copy of the Russian Makarov. Avoid common beers like Kamenitza or Zagorka, and try regional varieties. Bulgaria is a small country with many dialects, and people take regional differences in beer, brandy, and food seriously. Also, if you don't like Shumensko, I'LL FRAKKING CUT YOU.
