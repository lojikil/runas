Friday Roundup, written whenever, because, well I mean today is Friday (the 13th) so like whatever man.

# Ask Stefan Anything

- Why 

I swear to tangra, this is science, If you want to know "why" go take a philosophy class!

- what is the square root of purple

Wolfram Alpha tells me "data unavailable" and WebMD says I have cancer and lupus.

- why are badgers so suspicious? 

They're deeply angry, nocturnal creatures, still working on some issues, and going through their punk & heavy metal phase. Also, because they're literally ruling the world with the wainwrights.

- Why the *expletive* does Ubiquiti Firmware *expletive expletive*

Believe it or not, Ubuiquiti actually has some neat operating system choices under the hood. Did you know that OpenBSD has a native, self-hosting port to Ubiquiti?

- In what ways has the ubermensch failed to replace the absence of devine values and the prevalence of nihilism?

I think this is a pretty interesting question; if you think back to Nietzsche or Schopenhauer, you'd be struck by how much art was supposed to fulfill this sense of divine, and yet here we are with just our basest morals, plain and un uplifted. But I think this is where Sartre's categories fit in best: the vast majority of folk are within "facticity" (being in itself) or resentment. Very few reach that level of "being for itself" or "being for others" and indeed those categories require work & dedication. As many know, I'm actually an absurdist, so I've no notion that "god is dead," but rather trend towards the Buberian "god has been pushed out of reality." I think this vacillation between "for itself" and "for others" could be balanced by the divine, and previously it had, but we've lost that, and it's hard to altruistically live for others or live for one's self in a healthy fashion. So, devoid of hope, should we trudge back to depths of darkness? I'm Dr Rieux in Oran; if we do not do what is right, no one will. Live for *that*.

- Where would you go if you could go anywhere?

There's so many places I want to go in this lifetime; personally, I've been to most of Europe, twice to Turkey, to Canada, Bermuda, Bogota, and to Mexico (including once accidentally). In no particular order:

- Chile: I've a large number of friends in Chile, and I'd love to go see them. There's promises of food, and a trip to Machu Pichu.
- Dubrovnik (Croatia): It's pretty, it's old, they speak a language I can parse easily, and the food is good. What's more to ask?
- Chernomoretz (Bulgaria): I love this town; it's small, sun kissed, and pleasant.
- Sinope (Turkey): My cousins own condos here, and I've always wanted to go stay for like... a month
- Japan: I'm not really interested in Tokyo, tho I would go, but the smaller places, Kyoto, anywhere Hokkaido, would be great
- Vladivostok (Russia): the russian far-east has always intrigued me, and this is the most far-eastern Major city in Russia that I would probably find survivable
- Novosibirsk (Russia): This is a beautiful Science & old city in Siberia, the largest city in Asian Russia
- Lake Baikal (Russia): It's not as pretty as it used to be, but there's interesting things to be had
- Uzbekistan: I've always wanted to go to the central asian steppes.
- Mongolia: Fk'in Ulaanbaatar & Mongolian Barb, also yurts.
- South Africa, Cape Town, Durban, &c &c: I've a large family that still lives in Saffa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe, and I've always wanted to go. gaan liek to praat afrikaans die hele fokken tyd bru.
- The Maldives: I mean... it's bloody beautiful
- Bhutan: yes, I'm sappy, judge me. FITE ME.
- The Falklands: believe it or not, I've always wanted to go, I think it's a neat place, slightly like New Zealand, but with less people
- The Okrneys & the Faroes: just because they're so far off the beaten path

- What's the difference between chaos and randomness?

Ones from a butterfly, and the other is a mathematical function. They are inverses (and vice versa)

- Will I ever get that drone out of that tree?

No. It belongs to the tree now. The trees are preparing for war. Good job, giving them a predator.
